# AtliQ Brand Store Stocke Management Using LangChain LLM 

## Overview

The **AtliQ Brand Store Management Database Q&A Tool** is a web application designed to provide users with a convenient way to interact with a clothing store database. Developed by Shubham Khairmode, this project leverages a powerful stack of technologies, including **Google Cloud APIs**, **GoogleMakesuite API**, **GooglePalm**, **Google-GenerativeAI**, **Streamlit**, **Flask**, and a **MySQL database**. It offers users the ability to ask questions related to the clothing inventory and receive informative responses.

### Key Features

- **Intuitive Querying**: Users can simply type questions in natural language, and the tool interprets and processes these queries to extract meaningful information from the database.

- **Fast Response Times**: The tool employs advanced language models and efficient data processing to provide quick and accurate answers to user queries.

- **Informative Answers**: Users receive detailed responses, including relevant data and explanations, ensuring a thorough understanding of the queried information.

- **Modern User Interface**: The tool features a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit and Flask, making it easy for users to interact with the database.

## Technologies Used 

1. **GoogleMakesuite API**: This API is employed to access Google's suite of cloud services, which provides essential functionality for the project, including language processing and data retrieval.

2. **GooglePalm**: GooglePalm is a powerful language model from Google that assists in processing user queries and generating informative responses.

3. **Google-GenerativeAI**: This technology, likely associated with Google, contributes to the generation of human-like text, which is crucial for providing detailed answers to user queries.

4. **Streamlit**: The web application's user interface is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive and user-friendly data applications.

5. **Flask**: Flask is used as a web framework for routing and handling user requests, allowing for a smooth user experience.

6. **MySQL Database**: The project integrates with a MySQL database to store and manage the clothing store's inventory data.
